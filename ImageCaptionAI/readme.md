Introduction to Image Captioning

Image captioning is a complex and captivating area of artificial intelligence that involves generating textual descriptions for 
images. This process combines computer vision and natural language processing to create a cohesive narrative of the visual content. 
By understanding and describing the objects, actions, and contexts within an image, captioning models can provide insightful 
summaries that enhance accessibility, improve content discovery, and enable more sophisticated human-computer interactions. 
Applications of image captioning range from assisting visually impaired individuals to enhancing social media platforms with 
automatic tagging and description features.

Dataset 

The Flickr8k dataset has become a standard benchmark for sentence-based image description for beginners.Flickr 8k dataset contains 8092 images and up to five captions for each image. Such annotations are essential for continued progress in automatic image description and grounded language understanding.
