Introduction
Brain tumors are a critical health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project employs computer vision techniques to automatically analyze MRI scans and classify them into different types of brain tumors.

Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pandas
Scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled MRI scans of brain tumors. It includes images of various tumor types, along with corresponding annotations.

Dataset Source: [Provide the source/link to the dataset]

Methodology
The project follows these general steps:

Data Preprocessing: This involves loading the MRI images, resizing them if necessary, and performing any required data augmentation.

Model Architecture: Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify brain tumors based on the preprocessed images.

Training and Validation: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model.

Evaluation Metrics: Define appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to assess the model's performance.

Inference: Implement a prediction pipeline for unseen data.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd brain-tumor-detection
Run the main script:
