# Machine-learning-projects
Machine learning & Data science projects I am working on out of intrest!.

## Project 1: Delivery time predictor : 
#### Rationale : To Build a model to predict the total delivery duration for a delivery rider to reach his customer . 
Process : 

            - Used Seaborn and Matplotlib from visualisation of data and analysis
            - Conducted feature engineering such as cyclical feature encoding , one hot encoding & creating features from old ones
            - Simplified Evaluation Function as the heuristic
            - Pygame module for the environment and UI
